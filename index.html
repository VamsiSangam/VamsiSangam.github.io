                    <p> Howdy and welcome! My name is Vamsi Sangam, and I am a developer. I build big-and-small computer/mobile softwares and websites. I am extremely passionate about backend development, database design solutions and solving efficiency-critical
                        problems. I have experience in various programming languages such as C, C++, Java and C#. I have worked with many web technologies such as Java EE, ASP.NET MVC, jQuery, Bootstrap, etc. I offer elegant and effective solutions using
                        the best practices and standards. But I'm not an all-web-guy, I have a great interest in Data Structures and Algorithms. To help out my fellow Computer Science candidates, I have created another website
                        <a href="http://theoryofprogramming.com" target="_tab">Theory of Programming</a> which offers tutorials on DSA and Java.</p>
                    <p> I have built this website so that I can share my experiences with the whole world. No better place than the internet to do that, don't you think?! Here you can know a lot about my family, education, likes and dislikes. So, if you think we have a lot in common don't forget to <a class="smoothScroll" href="#contact"> ping me</a>! I absolutely love making new friends! </p>
                    <p> Currently, I am a Software Engineer in Microsoft (IDC), Hyderabad. Born on 29 <sup>th</sup> May, 1996, to my beloved parents Mr. S. V. R. Prasad and Mrs. Jaji Sangam, in the city of destiny, Visakhapatnam. Although I am mostly a geek, I love watching hollywood movies, playing games, social networking, listening
                        to music and hanging around with friends. </p>

                        <sup>th</sup> March 1963. He did his Bachelor of Law from NVP Law College and Masters in Human Resource Management (MHRM) from Andhra Unversity. He is a person who loves his job and has worked for over 30 years in the field of
                        HR. He first worked as an advocate at Visakhapatnam District Court, in 1986. Currently, he is a DGM in HR & IR at Gangavaram Port Services (India) Limited. As a father, he always ensured that I and my sister recieved the best of
                        everything, be it education, proper food, or anything. We never felt like we had the shortage of anything and I am very grateful to have such a father. For some reson, I can't lie to my father, I respect and idolize him a lot.
                        Everybody needs someone to look up to, to fuel their will and motivation, and for me, it's none other than my father.

                        <sup>th</sup> December 1972. She has done her M. Comm. and MBA from Andhra University. She used to be a lecturer in AGL college, Visakhapatnam, then she left it sometime when I was in my 2
                        <sup>nd</sup> standard, to ensure that mine or my sister's studies don't go out of hand! Ever since then, she personally took care of mine and my sister's education and everything else. Currently, she is a home-maker. Although
                        I said I obey my father a lot, I'm really a "mama's boy"! If I want anything I first ask my mother, and she generally doesn't say no, and then I urge her to go for the big leap, that is, asking my father for the final permission!
                        And sometimes my mother does things even without taking it to my father. So, my parents were always there for me when I needed them, knowingly or not, and I can say without the slightest hesitation that I have the best parents
