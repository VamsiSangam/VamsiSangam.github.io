                        <b>Internship at Flipkart</b> - Being a student of a premier institute (IIITA), I got a chance to earn my intern when Flipkart visited our campus in my 3<sup>rd</sup> year. After a full day struggling through the coding and interview rounds,
                        I was on cloud nine when I got selected for the summer intern! My internship was for two months, from the first week of June to the near-end of July. I had one of the most fun yet challenging experiences of my life in these two
                        months. Being in Flipkart for two months, I have too many things to say about my awesome experience! Here are a few of the most important aspects of my journey with Flipkart.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Interns at Flipkart are called Flinterns. It actually sounded nice and it seemed like a cool term that could be used in front of your friends. Flinterns do exactly what a full timer would do in the office. That's right! Flinterns actually build systems
                        which go to production. When I first understood this, I was wondering how could Flipkart put something so important into our hands which have no experience in production quality programming? But that's how things are done in Flipkart!
                        I found it pretty exciting that my work will actually contribute to Flipkart's growth. I was initially given the project, context sensitive address completion service. But it soon changed plenty of times when I reached Flipkart.
                        Finally, the project I worked on was shipment clustering where I had to use clustering techniques to boost the efficiency of the wish masters (person who delivers your package of happiness!). I was assigned a mentor, Piyush Kumar
                        Srivastava. He is the one to whom the whole team, Geo Intelligence and Mapping Team, reported to. So he was a very senior person. In the beginning I used to find it very odd to call him "Piyush" directly. Yeah, in Flipkart you
                        call anyone by his/her name. People give you a "whaaaat?" look when you call them sir/ma'am.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        <iframe class="pull-right right-side-box" src="https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m18!1m12!1m3!1d3888.6996122782552!2d77.63325933899692!3d12.927018041991882!2m3!1f0!2f0!3f0!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!3m3!1m2!1s0x3bae1460efa3526b%3A0xaaf756c6cd03321d!2sVaishnavi+Summit%2C+No.+6%2FB%2C+Summit%2C+80+Feet+Main+Rd%2C+Koramangala+1A+Block%2C+Koramangala+3+Block%2C+Koramangala%2C+Bengaluru%2C+Karnataka+560034!5e0!3m2!1sen!2sin!4v1483729193974" width="400" height="300" frameborder="0" style="border:0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
                        Every intern was also assigned a "buddy". Buddy is basically a full-timer who works along with you. A buddy is supposed to be the person who spends more time with you than your mentor. He is supposed to be the one who fixes your petty and huge troubles.
                        Well, I had a whole team of buddies! Everyone in my team were completely willing to help me out if I get stuck with anything. So I never had to ask who my buddy was. Janit Anjaria was one of my team mates. When I started my intern,
                        I was total rookie at almost everything my project demanded me to know. I didn't know any python, GitHub, ssh, etc. Janit was previously an intern who got a PPO. So he knew my situation pretty well. He was extremely helpful and
                        I used to ask him every little doubt I had. I troubled him with my doubts upto the extent he facepalmed himself! But he never gave up on helping me. He was my sensei! Abhranil was another extremely helpful team mate to whom I owe
                        everything I know about GitHub today. I remember when I wanted to ask him something really silly about git, he told me “If you ask now, you will be a fool now. If you don't ask now, you will be a fool for the entire life!”. And
                        Sourav Roy was another team mate who seemed to be like a very inert person but one I grew fond of as my intern progressed. Not just them but all the people at Flipkart are so helpful and talented that it makes the environment very
                        attractive to work.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I know I've been only to one company and this isn't much industrial exposure to say that Flipkart is the best place to work. But my friends shared their internship experiences in their companies. They tell how great their intern was and how cool their
                        office was. But none of it made me wish that I did my summer internship else where! And that's the kind of impression Flipkart leaves. When I started my internship, I was wondering on what basis was I put into the Geo Intelligence
                        and Mapping team, because the technolgies they were using never sounded any close to my reality. But at the end of my internship, I felt extremely satisfied to have explored a new domain, learned plenty of new stuff and made new
                        additions to my list of likes and strengths. In college, I spent most of my time building web applications, and I feel pretty comfortable developing web apps. When I saw my other friends I was actually glad that my project didn't
                        involve web stuff. Not that their projects were lame but I knew I wouldn't love working on it as much as I loved working on my project.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Interns are given production demanding projects which affect the companies performance. People at Flipkart are always ready to help you out whenever you need them. You can come and go whenever you want. You won't be questioned why you were late, but rather
                        you'll be questioned how your work is going. The office is just world class. I'm really glad I could intern at Flipkart. Flipkart is definetly the best place for building a career!
